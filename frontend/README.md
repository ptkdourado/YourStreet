  # Create login page

  This is a code bundle for Create login page. The original project is available at https://www.figma.com/design/1H5Ri5XBgEW7r6Nf6leAw8/Create-login-page.

  Additional Figma bundles (e.g. Social Feed Layout) can now be found in `./design/figma`.

  ## Running the code

  Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

  Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

  ## Backend integration

  Backend API URL is supplied via the environment variable `VITE_API_URL` in `frontend/.env`.
It should be set to `https://yourstreet-afh0echkdsbqf6ft.brazilsouth-01.azurewebsites.net/api`.

## Login options

The login card now lets users authenticate either via Google (OAuth redirect) or with a traditional
email/password form. The form is displayed when the user clicks "Entrar com email" and supports
registration and login flows.
